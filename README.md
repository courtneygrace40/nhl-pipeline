# NY Islanders Playoff Prediction 

Will the NY Islanders make the NHL playoffs this year? 

## I. Analyze how to predict the winner of a game via a machine learning pipeline -> this determines which factors influence a win for a simulation       
### 1. Get data via NHL API     
-Game data, including goals, etc (quantitative)       
-Home vs away, attendance can be considered as well (categorical)      

2. Clean/store data         

a. Determine which data needs to be stored        

3. Split data, execute ML pipeline with likely linear regression           

II. Create a simulation to determine how many games each team wins        

1. Use this to determine the likelihood that the Islanders make the playoffs
