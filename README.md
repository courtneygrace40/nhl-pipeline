# NY Islanders Playoff Prediction 

This project leverages the NHL API and Machine Learning to quantify the postseason probability of the New York Islanders during the 2025-26 season, providing a data-driven narrative to supplement traditional sports journalism.

## I. Analyze how to predict the winner of a game via a machine learning pipeline -> this determines which factors influence a win for a simulation       
### 1. Get data via NHL API     
- Game data, including goals, etc (quantitative)       
- Home vs away, attendance can be considered as well (categorical)      
### 2. Clean/store data         
- Determine which data needs to be stored        
### 3. Split data, execute ML pipeline with likely linear regression           
## II. Create a simulation to determine how many games each team wins        
### 1. Use this to determine the likelihood that the Islanders make the playoffs
